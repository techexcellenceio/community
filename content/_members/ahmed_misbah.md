Talks about #agile, #devops, #softwarearchitecture, #digitaltransformation, and #artificialintelligence



I have been working with Agile methodologies and practices for almost two decades, starting with Extreme Programming and most recently DevOps. I wore many hats in Agile teams including player coach, scrum master, developer, and architect. 

I believe that being and doing Agile helps software development teams deliver great software solutions that make everyone awesome. I love XP practices, my favorite being of course TDD.
