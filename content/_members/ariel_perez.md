name: Ariel Pérez
title: previously Executive Director, Head of Digital and Communications Platforms, International Consumer Bank @ JPMorgan Chase & Co.
about: "Ariel Pérez has had a diverse career in software engineering and product development, having worked at both large, global enterprises like JP Morgan Chase and at small startups like Try The World. As he’s gained experience across different domains and faced different technical challenges, one core belief has continually been reinforced in his mind: that putting people first is what has the biggest impact of all in any organization. He’s always strived to be a leader, rather than a manager in all his roles, whether they were purely in Engineering Management, in Entrepreneurship, in Product Management, or a combination of them. Ariel is currently the VP of Engineering for Measurement & Learning at Split, the leading feature management & experimentation platform that pairs the speed and reliability of feature flags with data to measure the impact of every feature."
