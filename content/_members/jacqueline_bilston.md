I'm also the co-founder and an organizer of the Calgary Software Crafters (https://www.meetup.com/calgary-software-crafters/).

Jacqueline is a software developer working in data engineering at Yelp, and a co-founder of the Calgary Software Crafters, a club dedicated to collaboration and sharing knowledge on how to make developer's lives easier. After almost 10 years in application engineering, she decided to switch things up, and learn something new by working with data. Sheâ€™s fascinated by the unique problems presented in testing big data applications, and is always happy to learn more about new approaches to testing them.
