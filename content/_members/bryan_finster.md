I’m a passionate advocate for and practitioner of continuous delivery who knows from experience that CD improves outcomes for the end-user, the organization, and for the teams implementing it. Deploy more and sleep better.

I have over two decades of experience delivering and supporting mission-critical supply chain solutions for very large enterprises. I'm the founder and former lead for the Walmart DevOps Dojo with hands-on experience both executing continuous delivery for production systems and helping other organizations find and remove the constraints that prevent a CD workflow.

Co-author of "Modern Cybersecurity: Tales from the Near-Distant Future", author of the 5-Minute DevOps blog on Medium, and a frequent speaker on all topics related to improving the flow of software delivery.
