Developer, Continuous delivery, TDD and crafting coach



Johan Martinsson is a freelance dev coach, passionate about code and software design.

A serial kata-creator and co-creator of conferences SnowCamp and AlpesCraft, facilitator of regular meetups since 2009, he often finds (good) excuses for showing code at conferences.
