Knowledge base : https://yoan-thirion.gitbook.io/knowledge-base/


I have designed software since more than 15 years now. My various experiences in fields like banking, insurance and industrial environments at Luxembourg helped me understand what was really fundamental to succeed in that area : agility and technical excellence.

That's why for a few years I am focusing on helping teams deliver well crafted software by coaching them on the implementation of agile practices.
