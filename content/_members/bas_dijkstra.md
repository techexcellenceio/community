# Hey, my name is Bas Dijkstra, and I am an independent test automation consultant and trainer. I have been active in the test automation field for some 16 years now, and have worked on software testing and automation solutions across a wide range of programming languages, frameworks and technology stacks. Iâ€™ve delivered test automation training to dozens of companies and hundreds of conference attendees in the Netherlands as well as abroad, to excellent reviews. I live in Amersfoort, The Netherlands, together with my wife and two sons. When I am not at work, I like to go outside for a long run, or to sit down and read a good book.
