Product Manager, passionate about generating business and customer value.

Too often product management is seen as a bit of luck combined with a lot of ego. As an alternative, I work evidence-based by conducting product research (e.g. user interviews, assumptions testing), with a data-driven, customer-centric, continuous, scientific, collaborative mindset.

My little product management manifesto:
- outcome over output
- data over opinion
- entrepreneurship over sticking to your job description
- research over "listening to your gut"
- continuous learning over big annual planning
- influencing over exercising control

Key skills: product discovery | software engineering | coaching | product strategy | business transformation | entrepreneurship | goal alignment.
