Software Architect, O'Reilly Author and Trainer, Keynote Speaker. Author of "Balancing Coupling in Software Design" and "Learning Domain-Driven Design"

Talks about #microservices, #distributedsystems, #domaindrivendesign, #softwareengineering, and #softwarearchitecture

I’m a software developer with nearly 20 years of industry experience. During the years I worked for companies large and small, in roles ranging from Software Engineer to Chief Architect. 

When away from work, I maintain an active media career as public speaker and blogger. I’m speaking at conferences around the world, on topics such as Microservices, Domain-Driven Design, and more. Alongside the media work, I have a keen professional interest in Distributed Systems, Software Architecture, and Software Design in general. 

In the remaining time, I read lots of books on various topics, fly R/C aircrafts, and rescue troubled cats and dogs. I always welcome professional enquiries, and can be contacted via InMail, Email, or Twitter.

Interests and expertise: Distributed Systems, Domain-Driven Design, Microservices, Event Sourcing, CQRS, Serverless Platforms, Cloud Computing, Software Achitecture, AI, Machine Learning
