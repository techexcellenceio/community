Contract Web Developer

Talks about #tdd, #cicd, #react, #testing, and #typescriptTalks 


I’ve been working in the industry for about 15 years. I’ve been doing TDD for about 10 years and have been doing TDD on the front end with React since the first version of React was released (around 2014).

I’ve worked at places like Electronic Arts, BBC Sport, Sky and Equal Experts, and have successfully delivered many large projects at scale using TDD in all of these places.

I believe the purpose of good tests is to give us the confidence to make changes over time, and I’d like to show some of the tools and techniques I use to make this happen in this talk.
