name: Alexander Pushkarev
title: Senior Software Engineer @ TripAdvisor
about: With more than 10 years in IT, I had a chance to work in different areas, such as development, testing and management. 
# I had a chance to work with PHP, Java, Python and .Net platforms with different applications from microservices to monolithic and monstrous desktop UI applications. With such a wide background I decided to focus on things that help to deliver high-quality software, starting from inception and all the way to operation. Currently, I am holding the position of Senior Software Engineer, but I prefer to consider myself a full-stack engineer.
