Talks about #tdd, #programming, #testautomation, #computerscience, and #artificialintelligence

With more than 10 years in IT, I had a chance to work in different areas, such as development, testing and management. I had a chance to work with PHP, Java, Python and .Net platforms with different applications from microservices to monolithic and monstrous desktop UI applications.

With such a wide background I decided to focus on things that help to deliver high-quality software, starting from inception and all the way to operation.

Currently, I am holding the position of Senior Software Engineer, but I prefer to consider myself a full-stack engineer.

My major areas of interests are:

-   Effective test automation approaches

-   Test automation framework architecture

-   Data analysis

-   DevOps

My passions are quality and efficiency. I am an agile fan and XP practitioner.
