I am passionate about connecting the dots between Wardley Mapping, Domain-Driven Design, and Team Topologies as a holistic approach to designing and building adaptive, socio-technical systems optimized for a fast flow of change. 

Previously, I was working as a startup CTO, and I have a background in computer sciences and experience in software development and software architecture since 2002. 

I am the author of the upcoming book "Adaptive Systems with Domain-Driven Design, Wardley Mapping, and Team Topologies: Architecture for Flow" (Addison-Wesley Signature Series (Vernon), 2024).
