about: Become a professional software developer and elevate your career to the next level 
# Become a professional software developer
# Learn how to take pride in your work and move forward in your career
# I'm a software developer with passion for creating great products. Domain-driven design & Test-driven development are some of my favorite tools. My code is clean and easy to modify, thanks to the modular, loosely coupled design achieved by continuous TDD iterations backed by a deep understanding of business requirements. I'm also a professional consultant and trainer. My clients include IBM, Roche, Nordea, Vattenfall, Asseco. In my free time I create online courses and write articles about software development, DDD and clean code.
